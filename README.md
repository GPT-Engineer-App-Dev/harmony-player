# harmony-player

Create a basic layout for the music player app with the following:

- A header section with the app title "My Music Player"
- A main section that will contain the music player controls and playlist
- A footer with a "About" link 

Use a modern, clean design with a dark color scheme suitable for a music app. Add some minimal music related imagery or icons to enhance the look.
